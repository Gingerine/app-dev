**My Favorite Series/Movies**
1. Dickinson
2. The Notebook
3. Our Beloved Summer
4. Ghibli Movies
5. Harry Potter

-There are a lot of *Ghibli Movies*, it includes **Ponyo** which I adore so much because of its cuteness. You can watch it whenever you are feeling happy or sad. It will surely make your mood lift up.
-I like Dickinson because of how realistic it can be, it shows how our world back then when women are considered as no higher than man. I also love every poetry in this series. It made me feel like I am being heard by someone, sometimes.
